SQL Server wants to go safe and will not allow a table to have multiple FK's with ON DELETE CASCADE, in order to avoid race between them.

So in order to achieve the desired effect (make sure there are no orphan entries in any table), we used INSTEAD OF triggers that specify what has to be done when a parent entry is deleted.
