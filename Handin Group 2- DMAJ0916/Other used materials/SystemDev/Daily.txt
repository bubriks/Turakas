Sprint 1
day 1
Previous scrum master and product owner was Hannes, next pr. owner is Ralfs, Scrum master is Stoicho.
We decided to focus more on chat instead of music part of our project.
We decided to make our main concurrency issue around Who gets final seats in chatrooms.
First phase of coding is around 80% done, UI is missing, Music player is not attached.

day 2
Part of UI has been made, music player has been added, but not merged with UI.
We decided that fighting over spots in hold 'em poker is more modern and present than chatrooms.
Some issues come with implementing poker to our project, like unknown amount of work and possibility to pivot.

day 3 
Conducted a daily standup meeting
We decided to not implement poker, but instead allow people to joing group and then allow groups to joing chatrooms - atomicity
Modified chat system
Set up plans and tasks for the end of week. Hopefully we have a working program by the start of next week

Project is good for alpha testing.
